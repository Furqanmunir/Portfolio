## 3 Artificial intelligence proved beneficial in pandemic COVID-19 situation

Artificial intelligence is a machine intelligence that work and solve tasks like human intelligence. It is possible to device new machines that will be helpful in the control and prevention of COVID-19 outbreak by using free and open source software tools.
AI is playing a vital role in the control of global crises that are arising continuously by pandemic COVID-19.  AI has wide range of scopes including from diagnosis to prediction and vanishing doubts to judging risks, from identification to delivery of food and services. During the current situation when the whole World is enclosed under the bonk of Corona virus, there is a serious requirement for the development of certain software and robots that are specifically designed to tackle covid-19 patients.

#### Development stages for software 

When there is a big project for example automatic machines useful for corona virus infected patients. There are five different stages for the development of any software that require different engineers and they work collaboratively. 1st stage is the beginning stage during which the desirous person that want a software tells his desires and need of work to the developing engineers. 2nd stage is the planning stage in which engineers plan by thoroughly understanding the requirements of end users. After 2nd stage engineers make a basic prototype of plan, this is the 3rd stage. During 4th stage they which is also called constructive stage engineers start their actual work and software is designed and coded. Software testers also done resting during this stage. Now the time comes for the 5th or final stages after the successful testing of software. This stage is also called a deployment stage. In this stage it is released for end users or customers. If they found any error during their work, engineers correct them by recoding or correcting the previous codes.

#### Benefits of AI during pandemic situations or ideas for that we can develop a software

1-	Since robots are non- living things and they are not infected with corona virus, we can use them for giving medication and care to infected patients.

2-	Many apps linked with AI systems are very helpful during pandemic situation. AI based apps can give medical assistance to infected patients and keep their records.

3-	AI based software are helpful in predicting the number of infected individuals. E.g. Netlogo

4-	AI based apps can be improved with time being and we can handle new situations effectively.

5-	Some apps can communicate with the patients without the intervention of human and proved themselves very effective during the current pandemic situation.
