## Veterinary profession

Many years ago, few people lived together at certain places and shared their things with each other. As we know that now the world population is growing very fast. There is a lot of hustle and bustle, especially in the cities. All living things  need food to live. Some animals  eat flesh, some eat grass, and some eat both. We humans are omnivores. We need a large amount of food for our body to work efficiently.

Veterinary profession is a broad profession that indulges for the welfare of mankind. Veterinary students spend more than 35+ credit hours per week to study this amazing profession. Their aim is to develop new techniques and breeds of animals that increase their production, they work for the betterment of human-animal interactions, they work to prevent the transmission of diseases from animals to humans and humans to animals. 
    
Veterinary students visit nearby villages around the university campus to give free extension work to the farmers. They teach farmers in many different ways so that the thing they want to inoculate in the mind of the farmer, they will succeed.
During summer vacations veterinary students join different summer internships offered by the International community. They spend their vacations learning new things and compare with the veterinary profession. Where they find a way, they incorporate their knowledge just for the sake of humans and animals.

They also work at abattoirs  where the use of Artificial intelligence is very common. They examine,  diagnose and pretend the fate of animals that come under their supervision. The earlier industrial revolution attempted to create those machines that could replace human’s physical power. Industrialization has totally transferred the society and brought immediate crises in later development. Infect there are various machines that can outperform human beings over the centuries. Man’s working capability and thinking process can now be replaced with AI techniques. Artificial intelligence is a method to make such devices that work like the human brain. AI relates with the working of the human brain that, how it works, receives impulses, interpretation of impulses and then to make the conclusion from the previous information stored in the brain. It can prepare a response by building a new idea after getting the message and then respond to it in the best way. The current examples of such devices or machines include computers or robots etc. AI approaches include machines that think smart like the human brain and solve problems as early as possible. So students also go for learning AI.

#### Conclusion

We have concluded from the above discussion that the medicine profession is linked with all new advanced techniques. If we adopt such things, then we can perform better work.

#### Introduction

The earlier industrial revolution attempted to create those machines that could replace human’s physical power. Industrialization has totally transferred the society and brought immediate crises in later development. Infect there are various machines that can outperform human beings over the centuries. Man’s working capability and thinking process can now replace with the AI techniques. Artificial intelligence is a method to make such devices that work like human brain. AI relates with the working of human brain that, how it works, receives impulses, interpretation of impulses and then to make the conclusion from the previous information stored in the brain. It can prepare a response by building new idea after getting the message and then respond to it in the best way. The current examples of such devices or machines include computers or robots etc. AI approaches include machines that think smart like human brain and solve problem as early as possible. (1)

Livestock is a broad sector that constitute animals and birds that are grown in order to fulfill the nutritional requirements of human being. Many years ago, the world population was small, and people are confined to specific regions. They keep small number of animals at home that were enough to fulfill their household requirements. Today the world population is growing very fast and there is an urgent need to convert that conventional methods of livestock that were practiced in past into new modern methods. Livestock is the largest sector of agriculture that contributes about 57% of Total GDPA from agriculture sector. Now there are many large dairy, beef, layer, and chicken farm established. Because they are living things, they also require feed on daily basis. In order to control and maintain this largest sector we need a system where the chances of mistakes are negligible. (2)

With the advent of computer every field of life is revolutionized. Now we can perform a better and excellence work with the help of latest software. These systems are also very successful in the field if livestock where we can transfer man-controlled sheds and farms into AI controlled sheds and farms e.g. Environmental control shed. (3)
 
#### Objective

The aim of the use of artificial intelligence in livestock sector is to hone the productivity of livestock sector. Intelligence is a broad subject that includes reasoning to observations, learning about the observations received, then solving the given set of problems whether verbal or non-verbal, perception, and linguistic intelligence. (4)
There are long term objectives or goals in the path of intelligence sector. The objectives of artificial intelligence include learning, knowledge, reasoning, planning, representation, processing of natural languages, and capability to move and interpret objects. (5)

#### Applications of AI

**Processing of natural languages**- Interact with modern devices that understand well the languages spoken by humans.
Gaming-AI has an essential role in the thinking of possible positions based on deep information in strategic games like PUBG, Commando etc.
 **Skilled or expert systems**- Software give comprehension and advice to their users.
**Vision system**- These systems can understand and elaborate the inputs given in the form of vision like Cameras.
Speech system- There are certain systems that are based on AI speech recognition that can hear and express as sentences and understand their meanings while a person talks to it like Google assistant.
Page recognition- There are certain page recognition software that read the text on the paper and recognize the shapes of the letters and convert it into editable text.
**Intelligent robots**- Robots are the current latest systems are work like human and can perform the instructions given to them by humans or operators. (6)

#### Application of AI in the control of livestock and environment pollution

It is interesting to know that AI has been widely used in many aspects of human lives. A good case is presented by Chan et al. (2003). The authors stated that AI could be applied to the reduction of environmental pollution, conservation and recycling since natural resources are signiﬁcant social and environmental concerns. As we know in the cattle and poultry farm, large amount of excreta and byproducts on daily basis are produced. We can utilize them in order to produce productive substances instead of throwing away that pollute the environment. The dung of animals is used to produce natural gas. Because natural gas plants are very dangerous for the farm as they can explode, so we can minimize the risk by using such sensors that can help us to know the safe amount of all gases that are produced in the plant or in the sheds and to keep them at the standard level. (7)

#### Application of AI in record keeping.

An averaged sized farm keeps about 1000 animals. If we keep the record of animals on register, it will take a long time and the chances of losing records are also possible. So instead of tagging we can place a tiny chip inside the body of animals that can be scanned when animals pass through the scanner located or build at a place. By scanning we can immediately recognize the data saved in that chips on our computer. Instead of opening our registers, we can keep and know all the information about the animals like age, breed, sex, pedigree and sick report quickly. (8)

#### Application of AI in diagnosis

Few years ago, we recognize the pregnancy of inseminated cattle through rectal palpation. There are three possibilities about the pregnancy status of cow i.e. not in calf, in calf and not confirmed. By the invent of Ultrasound machine we can recognize status very precisely. By using ultrasound machine, we can also diagnose many other diseases of animals. (9)

#### Use of robots at farm

Robots are modern automation technologies that are mostly used for the production and non-production works in order to facilitate the human lives. These robots are used at the abattoir, feed mills and inside the environmental controlled sheds. Many manufacturers are changed their old man powered plants into automatic plants that work more rapidly and precisely. Their examples include production of feed and packaging, processing of meat etc. (10)

#### Advantages

###### AI advantages includes:
-Easy diagnosis.
-more powerful and more useful.
-New and improved interface.
-Solving new problems.
-Better handling of information.
-Relieves information overload.
-Conversion of information into knowledge. (11)

#### Disadvantage

###### AI disadvantages includes:
-Increased cost.
-Difficulty with software development (Slow and expensive).
-Few experienced programmers.
-Few practical products have reached the market yet. (12)
 
#### Conclusion

We have concluded from the above discussion that if we transfer our dairy, beef and poultry farms into new and modern farms, we will be able to get more profits than with the conventional farms. With the conversion of man power into machines, it will enhance the production of farm, keeps record safe, and saves our time. Moreover; the daily cost also decreases. Livestock is the basis of any country from where our food and leather industry flourish. In future world seems more fast, we need remote techniques as much as we can in order to make life easier. So that we can get more profit from the limited resources by keeping an eye on them through AI. Such techniques are going to be the part of our lives nearly. So to cope up with such situation we need to get ready with new ideas in industry.
